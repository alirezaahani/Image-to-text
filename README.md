# Image to text
A simple program using tk and pytesseract for converting image to text  
You need to install pytesseract with pip and tesseract OCR on your os  
I don't know is this code gonna work on other os(I use lubuntu)  
## TODO  
- [*] Switch the graphic to qt
- [ ] Better interface
- [ ] Clean the code
